# Project C-Kit

## What it will be
The "C-Kit" is a small box, that contains several devices to establish a net for communication in disaster areas. It works independently from external power. It is a small "Communication-Kit".

Once powered-up it will provide a wi-fi-network with a radius of about 100 m. I will look for a relay station to get in touch with. Once they are coupled, they are looking for other C-Kits. From outside of the disaster-area there will an other kind of C-Kit, which are connected to the internet where possible and available. From there the internet will be connected to the C-Kits on the edge.

Once some C-Kits got connected, they will provide a small website, where people can connect with their mobiles and send some basic information to the rescue workers. For example: How many persons are alive, how many injured people are there, how serious are their injuries and things like that.

As hardware there shall be a SoC system like a Raspberry Pi. It may be any other device, too. As long as it provides Wi-Fi.

## Everybody is welcome to contribute
This is the "first idea". It will be elaborated over time. You are heartily welcome to contribute, as HW-specialist, as developer, as integrator, as rescue worker to provide requirements .... any one who has any idea or feedback.

A disaster could happen tomorrow in your street. So this is a small contribution to be prepared.
